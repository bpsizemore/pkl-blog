I created this repo as part of a blog post and an experiment. I wanted to use pkl pkl to generate kubernetes templates for a single-tenant environment
where each customer has their own dedicated API and resources. I attempted this shortly after the public release of PKL to see how it would compare to other viable solutions such as kustomize or helm.
